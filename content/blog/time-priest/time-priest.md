My dad sent me a text last night offering to give me 10,000 dollars,<br/>
as he had received an inheritance from his parents.<br/>

This depressed me this morning, as I couldn’t imagine<br/>
what I would want to do with the 10,000 dollars. I actually don’t<br/>
know how to spend my savings, the easiest thing to do is to horde them,<br/>
which at times makes me feel guilty. I tried to give a bunch away earlier this year,<br/>
but due to German gift tax it seemed like a bad idea, and<br/>
not the best use of the funds, so the hording continued.<br/>
I feel guilty to horde, guilty to spend on myself, and guilty to give away in<br/>
the not ideal way, and I feel guilty that this is not a real problem,<br/>
and that there are a billion people who would cringe reading this.<br/>
I imagine catherine reading this and hating me even more for writing this<br/>
and just telling me I should give the money to her. I imagine patty laughing<br/>
at this and agreeing. I guess in writing this I want pity from someone/thing/myself,<br/>
I feel like the anti-patriarchal idea that its ok to use or take advantage or hurt<br/>
a man or an ex who you are angry at for some reason which might be large or small<br/>
(assuming you can even can tell the difference)<br/>
as some type of retribution, is a sort of root issue,<br/>
its hard to put into words,<br/>
it makes my stomach turn.<br/>

Earlier this month, I didn’t move in with a friend in a beautiful apartment<br/>
because it was too expensive. On receiving the text from my Dad, I realized I should<br/>
have moved in with them, as having something I actually want to<br/>
spend my money on is rare.<br/>

I realized that most of my decisions in the past two months have basically<br/>
gone in the direction of trying to disappear,<br/>
trying to not spend any money,<br/>
trying not to see anyone,<br/>
disconnecting from sari-sari,<br/>
my happiest few days were when I imagined starting a farm with a friend,<br/>
which also was a form of escape in a way,<br/>
when meditating yesterday on a microdose I noticed I wanted to face towards the sky,<br/>
which I also realized was a desire for escape,<br/>
while meditating this morning, I found myself fantasizing about dying again,<br/>
and felt sad that this now a recurring fantasy for escape.<br/>

I don’t connect with my home situation,<br/>
I’m not putting in the life energy to try to be alive.<br/>

I briefly imagined that the way out of this was probably to “fake it to make it”<br/>
to try to act like I had positive life energy<br/>
and see if it turned into something<br/>
but imagining doing this felt awful<br/>

Catherine made an instagram story with a meme,<br/>
on one side was an image saying weak aura: “accept whatever life gives you”<br/>
on the other side was an image saying strong aura: “all we do is ball” ,<br/>
it seems kind of true but also upsetting to me<br/>
and I felt targeted (by much of her online content)<br/>
she would probably tell me it wasn’t about me,<br/>
with the unspoken undercurrent that this would bring me down further<br/>
pretending she is fine and not angry at me while clearly still angry at me<br/>
really aura is not contained in either of these forms<br/>
but in something behind them, and either can be misguided<br/>
people rushing to extremes, acting re-acting<br/>
on writing this I imagine there is some type of root thing inside me which is still sick<br/>
it might be related to the root thing I mentioned earlier<br/>
and it makes every thought train lead to a sort of breaking feeling of hurt and resignation<br/>
this is probably what it means to want love where its no longer there,<br/>
this is probably the definition of fixation<br/>
I don’t know<br/>

I imagine two polarities,<br/>
between knowing and not knowing<br/>
sometimes we need to realize that we do in fact know/feel something and act on it<br/>
other times its helpful to fall back in to the genuine not knowing<br/>
this dynamic can be felt tangibly through partner dancing in the interplay<br/>
between connecting with your partner, feeling lost, and moving from your own impulse<br/>
for instance, as I type about these polarities, this feels like a moment of knowing<br/>
about this,<br/>
and that perhaps for the most part with my situation in life right now<br/>
there is a strong feeling of not knowing<br/>

I wish I had moved into the apartment with Flor! it was beautiful,<br/>
why did I choose to try to disappear into this cold cheap apartment<br/>
where I feel like I’m just waiting for the next phase of life<br/>

I usually try to make my writing tie itself in bows more<br/>
fractal bows<br/>
a bow within a bow within a bow<br/>
no sentences without a happy ending<br/>

catherine and patty also kept telling me I should see a therapist<br/>
which I also resented<br/>
not because therapy is bad<br/>
but it seemed to me each should make their own decision<br/>
for the modality of healing they were drawn to<br/>
and I’m struck by the title of the book by James Hillman<br/>
“We've Had a Hundred Years of Psychotherapy--And the World's Getting Worse”<br/>

but somehow I do wish I could drop this writing off with someone,<br/>
the good and the ugly<br/>
and it could be healed through their reading<br/>
they could read it and accept it, like a priest or a true lover,<br/>
and it would all be accepted by them and in this acceptance released<br/>

if i was tying a bow,<br/>
I would say I am myself, the priest, the lover and the therapist,<br/>
and that I read it and release it<br/>

but perhaps its too soon,<br/>
maybe time is the priest<br/>
I don’t know<br/>
<br/>
