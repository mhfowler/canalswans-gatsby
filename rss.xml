&lt;p&gt;Sovereignty isn’t the same as individualism or as selfishness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sovereignty isn&apos;t about the nature of a decision that you make, it’s about the process through which the decision was arrived at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body Sovereignty, means “my body my choice”. Body Sovereignty doesn’t say whether a person should or should not get an abortion, it says that they should be the one to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body Sovereignty doesn’t say wether or not two people should have sex. It says that sex should take place without coercion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body Sovereignty doesn’t say whether or not someone should get a vaccine, it says that each person needs to make their own decision about what goes into their body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone may choose to get a vaccine because they’ve read that getting a vaccine will help protect the vulnerable, and they choose to get vaccinated not to protect themselves, but out of care for the world. Body Sovereignty doesn’t say that each person is an island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says someone should make that choice not because they feel they have no other choice, but because it is what they believe and choose based on their best understanding of the world. Epistemology and power are deeply entwined, and body sovereignty is an epistemology of the people. Some call it gnosis. Some call it citizen science. Ayurveda has a related term called &quot;Pramana&quot;. Body Sovereignty doesn’t say don’t seek the opinions of experts and elders, it says you must decide for yourself who to trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people may argue that disease is so dangerous and harmful, that disease is a special case which is more important than some theoretical principle of sovereignty. That freedom and safety are an axis which we make compromises between. Other people will argue that “people are dumb” and we need experts to make decisions for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My view is that sovereignty is not located on this axis. It is my experience that true respect for sovereignty even when you disagree actually leads to safety and connection at a deeper level. It was also the (continued) colonial violation of indigenous sovereignty that has led to genocide and so much destruction of the earth. It was also the religious missionary violation of sovereignty that justified so much harm under the guise of salvation. Every missionary believes their cause is worth the means at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that even suggesting sovereignty is a good principle, may be seen as a dangerous perspective, points to the level of coercion that is accepted as normal in our society. Perhaps this is to be expected in a world where we see advertisements against our will on a regular basis, and where platforms like instagram have a business model that relies on changing people&apos;s behavior to give their attention and resources to the companies that pay them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coercion and manipulation are deeply rooted in our culture (advertisements, police, data tracking, prisons, dark UX), but I’m still not really sure we can dismantle the masters house with the masters tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of friends who are anti-colonial and anti-capitalist, but somehow see vaccination, medicine, and the pharmaceutical companies as separate from these systems. To me this feels dissonant.  As though Pfizer doesn&apos;t have more than 1.3 billion in past criminal fines. As though crisis and trauma were not the perfect opportunity for power structures to establish themselves which will long outlast their virtue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the long history of connection between religion and medicine in cultures all around the world, freedom of religion, and medical freedom, seem deeply entwined. Given the inherent uncertainty of the world, even of science, even between scientists, at what point does forcing a medical perspective on someone else become a sort of religious missionary activity? And who gets to draw that line? Do we want to live in a world where white billionaires make those decisions for everyone? Even if you approve of their decisions this time, what seeds do we sew when we outsource those decisions to them? Will “experts” always have the experience of marginalized people in mind? Have they in the past?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A part of me feels these edge cases where we want to make an exception and throw sovereignty away, are actually the most important to pay extra attention to, to bring about deeper change, beyond the current news cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond my objections to vaccine passports, I feel like ending this letter with something else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you get vaccinated or don’t get vaccinated I will not ostracize you or look down on you. That’s your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blackpagebreak&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a letter from Txanahuya Hunikuī which I read via Scuttlebutt,
and inspired many of the topics I wrote about in the writing above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/2780811705491593/permalink/2789219701317460&quot;&gt;original letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yura Baka Nai Bai …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Native Nation Hunikuī of the Yuxibu Forest of the North Region of Pindo Abya Ayala …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday and today we lost two great Native Chiefs! One from the Native Native Nation Hunikuī, another from the Native Native Nation Katukina both victims of the vaccine they got!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean to make it clear to all of us brothers and sisters in authority that the extermination, ethnogenocide and genocides against us Native Nations in Pindo Abya Ayala continues to be promoted by the Brazilian state and its political rulers, managers, lawmakers, corporate business, industrial rural farmers, timber extractors, oil miners, etc!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demand justice measures against the Brazilian state and its political rulers, managers, legal legislators, and its biopiracy laboratories, colonizers, killers of the ministry, health secretary, hospitals, Sesai, Funasa, Anvisa, Disis base poles !!! Who insist on wanting to vaccinate our nations, relatives, families Native from Pindo Abya Ayala where we have already warned that we have not adhered, we do not accept vaccination in our Native Nations from Pindo Abya Ayala !!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are sending a copy of the same content to the Courts and operators who are experts in the laws so that the appropriate legal measures can be taken against the Brazilian state and its political governors, legal legislative managers !!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Txanahuya Hunikuī …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural Judge-TOAJ representative of the North region of Pindo Abya Ayala …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to phrase things perhaps, is that acknowledging, respecting and culivating the power of every human being,
to have domain over their own body,
could be a good starting point for a lot of things, small &amp;#x26; large, even when it may seem counter-intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Posture]]></title><description><![CDATA[In 2017, my neck and back started hurting to the degree it was hard for me to do basic things without pain.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/48db9327da21bb5e8307c322766f9b7f/computer.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, my neck and back started hurting to the degree it was hard for me to do basic things without pain. I knew the pain was connected with using my laptop. I decided to do a yoga class to see if that could help. At the end of the month long yoga class I went into a headstand for the first time and immediately heard a crack in my neck. I wasn’t able to move my head for the next week and it took months before I was not in pain again. It didn’t turn me away from yoga, just needed to be more patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve learned a number of different things to avoid reinjury — mostly just keep the screen at eye height — but the injury is always still somewhat there. This winter, while being very mindful to use my computer stand when working, I started getting wrist pain for the first time that prevented me from working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found that for me using a track pad, and computer on a stand, means no wrist pain and no neck pain. The location of the injury, the neck, seems like an obvious symbolism of the disconnection between head and body, which is also in a sense what the computer represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish that when I had first learned programming in school, someone had told me seriously to keep the screen at eye height, that you really need your neck. Along with a million other things it would have been nice to be told but you live and you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still learning what a healthy relationship with my computer could mean physically and emotionally. After living for a month without internet in my home, alone, during a pandemic, and then getting internet, I feel appreciative of the internet right now. I imagine periods of abstinence, balance, finding new non-extractive platforms, exploring, in variations for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m thankful for these two pieces of wood that I cut with a jigsaw in 2018, and have been keeping my computer propped up and my neck mostly functioning since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a brief account of an event that occurred in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse&quot;&gt;fediverse&lt;/a&gt; on January 2nd of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&apos;t heard of the fediverse before, &lt;a href=&quot;link&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is an article about it. In short, its a federated social network, where there are many instances (servers) and each server has its own admin(s) who decide which other instances to federate with. Users of a particular instance can see posts from their own instance, as well as other instances which their instance federates with. You can imagine it as a network of connected communities. A federation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t like your admin&apos;s federation choices (too strict, or not strict enough), or for any reason, you can also migrate your account to another server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, federation combines &quot;free speech&quot; with &quot;free listening&quot;. Anyone can create their own server and say whatever they want into the void, and at the same time no one has to listen to them (federate with them). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with this background, now into the details of the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artalley.social is an instance with 12,600 users (pretty large for the fediverse) which describes itself like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art Alley&lt;/em&gt; is a Mastodon server for &lt;em&gt;artists and commissioners&lt;/em&gt;, as well as people who just like looking at art. Share your finished pieces, works in progress, changes to your commissions status and your livestreams, or whatever else you want, really!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also say adult art is welcome, and they have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://artalley.social/about/more&quot;&gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, someone on artalley.social posted a pornographic drawing of a pokemon character who is underage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An admin of another instance saw this image, and reached out to the admin of artalley.social to report the image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The admin of artalley.social said that the image depicted a character who was underage according to canon, but the image was of the pokemon physically at a later age, and so was not against the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this, the admin of elekk.xyz decided to defederate from artalley.social, and made a post about why there were defederating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post circulated around the fediverse, and others weighed in with additional evidence of the failings of the moderators of artalley.social with a recommendation to block the instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g. this post with many screenshots &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunbeam.city/web/statuses/105497156571374148&quot;&gt;the supervillainess: You Should Defederate From artalley.social&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the posts above, the block recommendation takes a form similar to a legal argument -- with evidence/screenshots (receipts) and an explanation for why the evidence is worthy of a block. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common pattern on the fediverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block recommendations get shared around the network, which other instance admins may or may not follow and/or re-share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decentralized court by screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ ~ ~ ~ ~ a quote to pass the days ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the arguments recommending to block the instance,  I also saw posts from users complaining about the block, as they would have to change instances, when to them it seemed unfair that 12k users would have to change instances because of the bad actions of one user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &quot;ohcoolafrog&quot;, an artist I was following, posted this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently artalley.social server appears to be down, maybe the admins took it down. So I&apos;m not sure what happened to ohcoolafrog. Maybe I will find them again on another instance someday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that inspired me to write this, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://ondergrond.org/@dumpsterqueer/105491747322124960&quot;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; from an admin of ondergrond.org, a queer instance in belgium, about their thoughts on this process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To zoom out for a second, something I find beautiful about the fediverse, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is that its a place where these questions are being asked and lived out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether pokemon porn should be judged by the age of the character according to canon or according to the contents of the image is not the most interesting question to me, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but how this question gets answered, becomes a case-study for a deeper set of questions about  moderation and the network itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On centralized platforms there isn&apos;t nearly as much transparency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a post gets banned, it often just disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something gets shadowbanned, we may not even know its happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps central platforms just hide the politics of the messy reality from view.
Like so many capitalist &quot;solutions&quot; do.
Like the trashbin, the one-click-delivery, the polished rectangle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithms are a sweet poison. &lt;/p&gt;

organized into sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It includes arguments from epidemiologists at the top,
and from less accredited sources at the bottom along with an exploration of the role of conspiracy theories as myths,
a blue line denotes the separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can both be true that deaths from disease are heartbreaking and that extreme reaction to disease does more harm than good. Media polarization and sensationalism accelerates discussions into binaries, which has led to simplistic models and fear-based reactions,
a continuation of previous media and cultural trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as we can imagine that its better to be safe than sorry,
this sentiment can apply equally to the harms from Corona as to harms from the unprecedented lockdown.
I hope these resources can be an offering towards more holistic perspectives on public health wherever that leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b class=&quot;section-header&quot;&gt;Sunetra Gupta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read one thing, I recommend to read this interview, which gets at many of the epidemiological and social issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reaction.life/we-may-already-have-herd-immunity-an-interview-with-professor-sunetra-gupta/?fbclid=IwAR0ucQOKcLEDQNapy0RRFx3TQQ_VhiCANyFWZAzmRoUfHVp8BpablTZxceE&quot;&gt;An Interview  With Sunetra Gupta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunetra Gupta is an Indian infectious disease epidemiologist and a professor of theoretical epidemiology at the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford.
She has performed research on the transmission dynamics of various infectious diseases, including malaria, influenza and COVID-19,
and has received the Scientific Medal of the Zoological Society of London and the Rosalind Franklin Award of the Royal Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing her perspective, it should at the very least be seen that the debate around public health and Covid-19 is not as simple
as scientifically literate and illiterate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b class=&quot;section-header&quot;&gt;The Great Barrington Declaration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 5th, Dr. Gupta, Dr. Kulldorff and Dr. Bhattacharya jointly published The Great Barrington Declaration,
which outlines some pieces of the issue in short form:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gbdeclaration.org/&quot;&gt;https://gbdeclaration.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More from Kulldorff:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/10/09/lockdown-is-a-terrible-experiment/&quot;&gt;Lockdown is a terrible experiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/herd-immunity-is-still-key-in-the-fight-against-covid-19&quot;&gt;Herd immunity is still the key in the fight against Covid-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff points to the ways that even just from the harms from Covid alone,
general lockdown may be doing more harm than good, and the burden of lockdown is not shared equally between rich and poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b class=&quot;section-header&quot;&gt;Infection Fatality Rate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This often-cited statistic carries a great deal of heterogeneity by time, place, population and definition.
This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf&quot;&gt;meta-study&lt;/a&gt;, published on October 14th, 2020,
from the WHO website, looked at 61 studies around the world, and found that the
Covid IFR for people under 70 ranges from 0.00% to 0.31% with a crude corrected median of 0.05%, and a general population
median infection fatality rate of 0.27%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for a number of reasons, I don&apos;t think infection fatality rate is actually the best statistic for thinking about risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; looks at the risk from Corona in terms of equivalent risk from normal life at your age. It found that
whatever age you are, the risk of dying after getting Corona was roughly equivalent
to the natural risk of dying without corona in the next year at that age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;margin-top:0px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/content/blog/the-war-on-pathogens/img/covid-risk.png&quot; className=&quot;figureImage&quot; style=&quot;{{&apos;width&apos;: &apos;100%&apos;}}&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The mortality risk with COVID-19 superimposed on background annual risk, from &lt;a class=&quot;caption-link&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196&quot;&gt;&quot;How much &apos;normal&apos; risk does Covid represent?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other estimates, such as by nobel-laureate Michael Levitt, have placed the equivalent risk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@michael.levitt/the-excess-burden-of-death-from-coronavirus-covid-19-is-closer-to-a-month-than-to-a-year-83fca74455b4&quot;&gt;one month of normal life&lt;/a&gt;.
I speculate the true number is somewhere in between and would like to see this graph reproduced using more recent data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the exact risk is, to me this way of looking at risk contextualizes it in a way
which feels more relevant than other metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b class=&quot;section-header&quot;&gt;Harms From Lockdown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harms from lockdown are various and many may never be fully quantified or even known. Some are very direct, like
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-09-covid-annual-tb-deaths.html&quot;&gt;525,000 additional people projected to die in 2021&lt;/a&gt; from tuberculosis because of decreased access to care.
Other effects are more insidious — what are the long-term effects on children being taught to fear other children and physical closeness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the effects already being seen,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-09-covid-annual-tb-deaths.html&quot;&gt;COVID-19 may add 525,000 to annual TB deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm&quot;&gt;During June 24–30, 2020, U.S. adults reported considerably elevated adverse mental health conditions associated with COVID-19. Younger adults, racial/ethnic minorities, essential workers, and unpaid adult caregivers reported having experienced disproportionately worse mental health outcomes, increased substance use, and elevated suicidal ideation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-health-middle-east-africa-united-nations-619efb65b9eeec5650f011b960a152e9&quot;&gt;New Polio outbreak in Sudan from suspended vaccination campaigns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/international/2020/06/22/covid-19-has-led-to-a-pandemic-of-plastic-pollution&quot;&gt;Covid-19 has led to a pandemic of plastic pollution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a sample, but the scale and diversity of impacts suggest this a pointer to the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b class=&quot;section-header&quot;&gt;Cases, Testing &amp;#x26; Media Coverage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would probably be a whole other book to look specifically at how the state of the media is effecting
the cultural and scientific discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One small piece of this is reporting corona cases on a daily basis.
The graph below, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-covid-cases-deaths?time=2020-01-01..latest&quot;&gt;Our World In Data&lt;/a&gt;, shows the disconnection between global number of cases and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/content/blog/the-war-on-pathogens/img/cases-and-deaths.png&quot; className=&quot;figureImage&quot; style=&quot;{{&apos;width&apos;: &apos;100%&apos;}}&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Cases plotted against deaths worldwide, from &lt;a class=&quot;caption-link&quot; href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-covid-cases-deaths?time=2020-01-01..latest&quot;&gt;Our World In Data&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sources also point to this, even including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/20/world/covid-19-coronavirus-updates#a-third-surge-of-coronavirus-infections-has-now-firmly-taken-hold-across-much-of-the-united-states&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;,
but reporting based on cases continues to center fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear-based reporting is perhaps best exemplified by the trend of reporting the number of Corona deaths in terms of multiples of 9/11,
an event which was itself perhaps the most politicized and utilized-to-incite-fear event in recent history, hardly a sane reference point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b class=&quot;section-header&quot;&gt;Security Theatre&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to the harms caused by lockdown, it becomes clear that at the very least, it is not the case that
all efforts to prevent the spread of Corona are beneficial and moral, regardless of their efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we acknowledge that the strategy/ideology of restrictions have costs, then we can at least aim
that preventative measures are informed by efficacy. In reality, many preventative measures are informed
by public perception of liablity, moralizing and germophobia, with varying levels of alignment with actual efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/schools-arent-superspreaders/616669/&quot;&gt;Schools Aren’t Super-Spreaders, Fears from the summer appear to have been overblown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-09-covid-infections-respiratory-droplets-aerosols.html?fbclid=IwAR0daSP2vCyfUlxxVtS6SGB9RVCeNPHgoxBPWoIZbUWjK0p6n9LaiPp-lyY&quot;&gt;Corona is not easily transmitted through surfaces&lt;/a&gt;, yet &apos;deep cleaning&apos; helps people feel more at ease (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8291771/New-York-subway-closes-time-workers-perform-deep-clean-Covid-19-lockdown.html&quot;&gt;e.g. deep-cleaning new york subway&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking hospital bed capacity (the original motivation for the initial lockdown) makes sense,
as well as building more hospital capacity, but general lockdown disconnected from hospital capacity increases harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b class=&quot;section-header&quot;&gt;Long Covid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Long Covid is a real concern (my mom experienced a form of it, having symptoms for 4 weeks after getting Covid),
next to the harms of lockdown, justifying lockdown in terms of long covid seems like a sort of shifting ground argument
and hard to universalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who work on the computer, have stable home situations and are less effected by restrictions,
they will see the tradeoffs differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately our assessment of risks will involve many different factors. My feeling is not that Covid isn&apos;t real,
but that a number of societal biases have effected the way that it is understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b class=&quot;section-header&quot;&gt;Root Causes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The societal bias that lockdown is good for public health is an outgrowth from the colonial perspective that humans are separate from nature
and that the human body is a pure sterile space (ignoring the microbiome and that humans actually have an ecological relationship with viruses and bacteria).
This bias continues capitalist trends towards alienation from nature, each other, and our bodies, and furthers the deterioration of our health,
which truly was already in a public health crisis long before corona (from pesticides, pollution, climate change, capital-influenced healthcare, the opioid crisis, biodiversity loss, lack of access to nature, and other factors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if we could have had a perfect lockdown in March we could have prevented
the spread of the virus entirely. But given that didn&apos;t happen, it seems likely Covid will become endemic like other coronaviruses. There are many other new normals one could imagine instead of &quot;the war on pathogens&quot;,
even if that would be the most profitable for pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I dislike the way that most writing online ends.
As though everything needs to be tied into a bow for jury submission.
Given that I see polarization as part of the problem,
I wasn&apos;t sure how to write about this in a way that doesn&apos;t further contribute to that cycle.
Separate from the framework of thesis-counterthesis,
I hope some pieces of this might be a source of grounding, information or perspective.
The next sections are about conspiracy theories as a form of myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blue-line-break&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b class=&quot;section-header&quot;&gt;Origin Of The Term &apos;Conspiracy Theory&apos;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
While &apos;Conspiracy Theory&apos; is often used as a term to dismiss an argument, its worthwhile to recognize the history of the term.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a nuanced discussion of the history and role of conspiracy theories, which acknowledges that they
can both contain truths and also mislead, I recommend this podcast:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://novaramedia.com/2020/08/13/microdose-erik-davis-on-the-cosmic-right/&quot;&gt;Microdose: Erik Davis on the Cosmic Right&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also appreciate Carl Jung&apos;s notion that even when not literally true, conspiracy theories often have some
seed of truth to them, and can be interpreted through a form of dream interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if we look at the Chem Trails conspiracy theory, that the smoke trails seen behind planes
are trails of poisonous chemicals released into the air by the government to mind control the population
and control the weather — I don&apos;t literally believe this conspiracy theory,
but given the connection between air travel and climate change,
there is a sense in which the conspiracy theory is more true than the person who says the jet trails are harmless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a further note, I actually can&apos;t remember where I read about this Jung theory of conspiracy theories,
and its possible that I  made it up, or that perhaps I dreamed about it. If anyone knows a source for this,
please send it to me, as I think about it often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this perspective, I think the idea that conspiracy theories need to be censored or are the cause of
problems in the world, doesn&apos;t hold up.
I would ask first why someone is in a position where conspiracy theories are the best model
for their lived experience of reality, before trying to silence them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, many conspiracy theories hold truth, and some point to paradigm shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its an interesting epistemic ground, and perhaps like a Tarot reading, can be either spooky, misleading,
healing or informative, depending on how you engage with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this introduction, here are some less accredited sources on this topic, to be navigated with your own
discernment to guide you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the pathways immediately around us that lead to information being transmitted into our eyes and ears?
What effects do these structures have on us?
What agency do we have in how we relate to them? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Must&apos;ve skipped the ship and joined the team
For a ride
A couple hours to learn the controls
And commandeer both my eyes
Hey!

&lt;p&gt;On November 18th of 2018
I decided that I would try to use a flip-phone for somewhere between three months and a year,
along with keeping a journal of emotions that arose for me during the process,
marking on a calendar any days where I used my smart phone,
building &lt;a href=&quot;http://mfowler.info/work/disconnection-practices&quot;&gt;a robotic machine&lt;/a&gt; which physically childblocks your smart phone,
and creating a collection of all the maps I drew for navigating the city while using the flip-phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the journal, on December 14th, I imagined titling this collection of activities &lt;em&gt;The Origin Of Maps&lt;/em&gt;, here is my note from that day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12/14/18 (friday)&lt;br&gt;
thought of the title The Origin Of Maps&lt;br&gt;
a reference to direct experience, where all maps, originally, come from&lt;br&gt;
by the time we see an address inputted into Google Maps,&lt;br&gt;
there have been many layers of mediation&lt;br&gt;
The Origin Of Maps invites a return to direct experience&lt;br&gt;
using the flip phone, you have to think of who you want to text or call&lt;br&gt;
like imagining a UI based on blank screen&lt;br&gt;
the only ideas that surface are the ideas that originate from you  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, using a flip-phone was an effort to call into question what is truly nourishing
and not passively accept the status quo.
I didn&apos;t want to do something speculative.
Even if small, I wanted to make a concrete change to my life to prioritize direct experience and rest, a form of direct action.
I considered it more as a ritual in tribute to mindfulness than an experiment with a single result.
I think many people overestimate how often a smart phone is necessary,
but it depends on what&apos;s happening in your life and I do not intend to make any universal claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could tell that I exhibited certain compulsive negative habits with relationship to my smart phone,
and from VR to AI I could see that the tech industry was full of overhyped narratives.
I questioned in what ways this surveillance-funded gadget made from rare earth metals was truly serving me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my journal entries from the first 10 days after I decided to use a flip-phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day 1 (sunday)&lt;br&gt;
picked up raspberry pi from kleinanzeigen and hung out with mylene&lt;br&gt;
missed my turn on the way to kleinanzeigen pickup,&lt;br&gt;
but used map in my bag to figure out where I had missed the turn&lt;br&gt;
(felt like my rope harness catching me from falling)   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day 2 (monday)&lt;br&gt;
took my iphone with me because I wanted to use a weird app&lt;br&gt;
to text a weed dealer about buying weed&lt;br&gt;
which I thought was only available on iphone&lt;br&gt;
but turns out also has desktop version   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day 3 (tuesday)&lt;br&gt;
took my iphone with me to studio because I was feeling like texting from the corner of the studio was nice&lt;br&gt;
was feeling unsure about the project,&lt;br&gt;
and frustrated that people were having trouble understanding how I wanted to be reached&lt;br&gt;
in the evening left studio without my smart phone&lt;br&gt;
felt rejuvenated by patty texting me updates to where the birthday party she was at was,&lt;br&gt;
even though we had been messaging before on telegram.&lt;br&gt;
she understood the system I wanted to use and laughed and told me it wasn’t that complicated   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day 4 (wednesday)&lt;br&gt;
left my iphone at home in the morning&lt;br&gt;
felt excited about project in general&lt;br&gt;
as a way to provide some structure and direction to my life&lt;br&gt;
to frame a period of life as research and ritual   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day 5 (thursday)&lt;br&gt;
felt good to only have flip-phone during the day&lt;br&gt;
and at night-time while returning to my apartment&lt;br&gt;
was excited to see what messages i had received on telegram  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day 6 (friday)&lt;br&gt;
using flip phone feels like gently scuba-diving away from my computer everyday&lt;br&gt;
messaging during the day, it was not so difficult making plans for the weekend   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day 7 (saturday)&lt;br&gt;
thought I had memorized directions, but realized I hadn’t memorized what to do after getting out of the u-bahn&lt;br&gt;
successfully navigated the final part by asking strangers on the street for directions    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day 8  (sunday)&lt;br&gt;
dan says “you are really making life complicated… flip-phone, veganism”&lt;br&gt;
he tells me he and a friend have been writing a song for fun with the lyrics&lt;br&gt;
“gimme me vegan ramen… fuck u…. vegan doc martens…. fuck u….&lt;br&gt;
Berghain (it used to be better)….
Sysyphous (it used to be better)….&lt;br&gt;
About Blank (it used to be better)”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day 9 (monday)&lt;br&gt;
catherine lost her computer while on vacation and spent a week without computer or phone&lt;br&gt;
she says she feels a bit feral, but in a good way. I feel like I can also feel a difference&lt;br&gt;
she is dreaming of having no laptop,&lt;br&gt;
just having her computer be in a physical location where it is used.&lt;br&gt;
or of getting a job with her hands, becoming a cook   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;day 10 (tuesday)&lt;br&gt;
enjoyed getting coffee with Isaac, and baking a sweet potato for myself in the evening.&lt;br&gt;
not sure if this deserves to be in the journal or not, but it felt nice to buy a single sweet potato, and take it home and bake it and eat half of it for dinner (with rice and beans) and then eat the other half for breakfast the next day with eggs  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made a physical zine with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cath.land&quot;&gt;Catherine Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; about
disconnection practices as healing practices. If you would like to read it, you can order a copy here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gumroad.com/l/pgQxJ&quot;&gt;Disconnection Practices&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a bit about ups and downs I went through of wanting to “end the project” and go back to using my smart phone at different points, and how ultimately I “gave up” in May but then two days later I went back to using my dumb phone by choice and I didn’t feel as agitated anymore when it was now no longer part of an experiment but just something I was doing and could stop whenever I wanted.
I then continued to use the dumb phone for the rest of the year until November 29 of 2019, except for a period when I was in the US without a working sim card.
I particularly look back highly on the first three months where I felt a lot of excitement and newness.
I am currently using my smart phone again and I may take more time away in the future.
I especially dream of being in more situations where I am so engaged with my surroundings that my smart phone ends
up staying in my bag out of batteries for days without me noticing. Disconnection practices can be a tool to help us reconnect with our senses and find rest in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a short philosophical digression, one could argue that even our &quot;direct&quot; visual perception is mediated by culture and our past experience and so in some sense is also not direct. On the other hand, we all know the difference between hearing someone tell you what someone else said (a form of mediation) and hearing it directly. So like many philosophical questions, we can see that there is some ambiguity, but also like touching our nose with our finger or breathing there are lots of things we can do without knowing exactly how we do it, and we can still speak about a spectrum from more direct to less direct in a useful way. If I needed a definition of direct for this writing, it might be &quot;without being recorded&quot;.   &lt;/p&gt;

two nights ago I dreamed that I&lt;br&gt;
was trying to get a job at a pizza restaurant&lt;br&gt;
all of a sudden it all made sense&lt;br&gt;
why artists work at pizza restaurants&lt;br&gt;
it felt like a cosmic gift&lt;br&gt;
joyfully revealing itself&lt;br&gt;
feelings of relief&lt;br&gt;
on the first day we were a having a meeting with the staff&lt;br&gt;
and the boss was telling us&lt;br&gt;
that we needed to clean and organize the restaurant&lt;br&gt;
she said she wanted to add an aquarium to the main room and asked me to go find an aquarium tank&lt;br&gt;
i took the train to go find the tank&lt;br&gt;
somehow i took a wrong turn&lt;br&gt;
i was worried i would be late&lt;br&gt;
i had a stress dream about trying to find the aquarium tank store&lt;br&gt;
i woke up while still trying to triangulate where the store might be&lt;br&gt;
--&gt; on the way to 2020,&lt;br&gt;
with hopes of growing ecological alignment&lt;br&gt;
delicious pizzas&lt;br&gt;
happy solstice &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Desert Flowers]]></title><description><![CDATA[I spent the past month in New Mexico — in Albuqurque for a week, then 10 days at a ranch in Carrizozo, where I spent a lot of time sewing…]]></description><link>http://canalswans.commoninternet.net/posts/desert-flowers</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://canalswans.commoninternet.net/posts/desert-flowers</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 23:19:51 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I spent the past month in New Mexico — in Albuqurque for a week, then 10 days at a ranch in Carrizozo, where I spent a lot of time sewing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past three years Palace has had an annual 10 day residency taking place in Poland with around 250 people. The purpose of the project this September was to develop groundwork for a new residency that will take place in Carizzozo next September, and I came along to help out. There were around 20-30 people who were with the group at different points, many from Europe and many from New Mexico. People arrived and left at different points based on their availability. This development month was funded by 15,000 dollars loaned from patrons who wanted to support the project, and the basic arrangement was that if you could pay your travel to get there, you would be provided with food and accommodation while you were there helping out. Some of the Palace organizers were also working on applying for grant funding for the future, but for the most part it was a pretty decentralized group, converging via a shared vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciated that the organizers put out a clear open call with what dates the group would be in which locations, but leaving a lot of space for what would happen once we were there — both because it was unknown, and because they wanted to leave room for input and direction from whoever showed up and from New Mexicans we met through outreach along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first week in Albuqurque the group primarily congregated around Tortuga gallery, in a large room working on their computers. In the second two weeks we went to Pino Ranch in Carizzozo, which is the planned site for the future residency. The Pino family is interested in creating a residency at the ranch mostly because they would like see the space being used by a creative community and want to support that. As part of the exchange, Palace also offered to build structures which will be of use to the Pino family throughout the year, and to do some repairs such as fixing the roof on an old barn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structures that exist at the ranch are pretty minimal. It’s not some big complex, but rather one house and a lot of space with some abandoned cattle-related stuff and barbed wire fences. There is a lot of open space and not a lot of shade. Most of the build related projects we were working on there had something to do with shade. It would get really hot in the day and everyone wore big hats, and cold enough at night that I was wearing multiple layers while sleeping in my tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being harsh conditions in a way, its also very beautiful and full of life. While I was there, I saw two tarantulas, lots of beetles, stick bugs, birds, two snakes, lizards, grasshoppers, a beautiful hare with long ears, and lots of flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main build project we ended up completing was putting in tall 4x4 wooden posts into the ground with concrete bases, which would hold up a giant patchwork of cloths we made from sewing together lots of fabric and sheets from thrift stores, to give shade to a series of wooden tables and benches we also made (I use “we” here liberally, I mostly was sewing). A banquet area so that around 50 people could eat together. I appreciated that this was the primary orienting project, creating a space for a communal meal felt like building a keystone. On the last night before breakdown, we ate dinner at the table beneath the shade structure — the table was much too large for the size of our group that was there which felt fittingly symbolic for the idea of an open community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many of us there and so little shade at times I felt claustrophobic — I found relief when I identified this feeling and started calling it ranch fever. It was interesting to see the dynamics of people building together, both professional builders and people with less experience. I appreciate that the lead of the build team (Jackie) is a woman, and did a really good job deflating some of the ego and gender related energy that can emerge with Construction. We also had three performance nights along the way where different people played music, read poetry and danced, as a form of outreach, and as a way to enjoy each other. On the last performance night, I poured concrete with a friend into a tire to put up a “mobile shade” fence post, while two other friends danced around us in front of a projection. It was inspired by the day before, where in the middle of pouring concrete I had got distracted and starting dancing with Franz around the shade pole until Jackie reminded me were in the middle of something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel a conclusion reaching out like it wants me to find one. I could say something about being in community through ups and downs. I could say something about dishes and communal experiments. About my attraction to non-institutional creative communities. Or about going for a run each morning, and 15 minutes away from ranch fever how silent it is out there. I have lots of memories of the textures of fabrics while sewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this project continues to grow and to get the chance to spend more time there next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In search of and with gratitude for creative community and spiky flowers,&lt;br&gt;
M&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of paint the streets is to put chalk spray paint, stickers and flyers around the city to raise awareness for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://extinctionrebellion.us/rebels-without-borders&quot;&gt;synchronized set of XR actions&lt;/a&gt; beginning October 7th at the same time in Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Paris and New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paint The Streets is one of many initiatives intended to help more people learn about the upcoming protests so that they can form affinity groups in the coming weeks and participate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me Paint The Streets has become an interesting exemplar of my ongoing interest in how decentralized organizing works. Images for XR stickers and flyers are available online so technically anyone could go and print these stickers out and put them up anytime, but organizing an event to do so facilitates alignment and momentum, and if lots of people participate all throughout the city at once it might have a more visible effect than individual people putting up stickers at different times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of organizing my own event, I also could have simply joined one of the pre-existing meet-ups where people were gathering for Paint The Streets, essentially being an individual contributor. I was interested in organizing an event at Sari-Sari because it seemed like a nice way to contribute to this action with friends -- to form an independent group that was also aligned with something beyond itself. Part of what&apos;s interesting about decentralization to me is that I wouldn&apos;t even need to tell the original organizer of the Paint The Streets action that I was organizing my own event -- by simply organizing the event on the same day it would be in alignment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea reminds me of murmurations, as described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.de/Emergent-Strategy-Shaping-Change-Changing/dp/1849352607/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=emergent+strategy&amp;#x26;qid=1567724013&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Emergent Strategy&lt;/a&gt; by Adrienne Maree Brown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dream is a movement with such deep trust that we move as a murmuration, the way groups of starlings billow, dive, spin, dance collectively through the air—to avoid predators, and it also seems, to pass time in the most beautiful way possible. When fish move in this way, they are shoaling. When bees and other insects move in this way, they are swarming. I love all the words for this activity.
Here’s how it works in a murmuration/shoal/swarm: each creature is tuned in to its neighbors, the creatures right around it in the formation. This might be the birds on either side, or the six fish in each direction. There is a right relationship, a right distance between them — too close and they crash, too far away and they can’t feel the micro-adaptations of the other bodies. Each creature is shifting direction, speed, and proximity based on the information of the other creatures’ bodies.
There is a deep trust in this: to lift because the birds around you are lifting, to live based on your collective real-time adaptations. In this way thousands of birds or fish or bees can move together, each empowered with basic rules and a vision to live. Imagine our movements cultivating this type of trust and depth with each other, having strategic flocking in our playbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions about organizing and aligning with something larger than myself have been recurring for me in the past year. Particularly over the past few months as I&apos;ve been going to different XR meetings in Berlin trying to learn how it works and how I could contribute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the feeling that there is a subtle art to balancing independence and alignment. If you act in a completely decentralized fashion, if you go protest alone (or simply reduce your own individual consumption), you don&apos;t have much power. If you try to contribute by only following specific instructions from a centralized organizer, this may also not be the best. At some point your best contribution is to become a listener and also an organizer -- to listen to the broader patterns and also to take your own initiative, to move as a murmuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This struck home with me when I realized that someone I knew gave a workshop about XR at Floating University because they independently applied to give the workshop, their application was accepted, and then they ran a really beautiful workshop for around 50 people. This type of self-initiative in some ways defies the logic of top-down organizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t end up organizing the Paint The Streets event at Sari-Sari because I decided to leave Berlin for the month of September to participate in this project in New Mexico (I just arrived back in the US today). But I wanted to share this idea, perhaps someone else will manifest it or it can manifest in a different way at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine a network of communities each with their own interests, also aligning to create power together,&lt;br&gt;

If I accidentally also adopt his tone of voice, mimicry is a form of compliment. Before I was using my newsletter just for updates, but now I will also be using it as a place for writing. I was thinking about making multiple newsletters, but that seemed complicated. Instead I will just trust you to unsubscribe or mute if you want to, or to keep reading and hope that the topics that draw my interest might also end up being interesting to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I wanted to write about for this first new edition of the newsletter (now called Canal Swans) is organizing a basement, but it needs a little background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year, I’ve been helping out with a community space called &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarisarisalon.org/&quot;&gt;Sari-Sari&lt;/a&gt;. The space feels a bit like a strange living room. There is a carpet and a small stage and an open kitchen, it can comfortably hold about 30 people, but most events there have fewer people. There is an emphasis on improvisation, but not the type of improvisation that you train for, more just as a general mindset, working with what’s there. The open kitchen easily lets people walk back and forth from the carpeted area to “behind” the bar to the kitchen area — I think this lack of barrier between front and back greatly contributes to the ethos of the space. A lot of people who enter the space come up to the bar and ask “what is this place?”. It takes people different amounts of time to (un)learn that they can walk behind the bar and help cook if they want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the back of the living room is a door with a taped on arrow pointing downwards to the basement. This door seems to often get used for dramatic effect by performers and dancers who mid-performance walk through the door and close it, and then at some point come back in. The stairway down leads to an old but now well-organized basement. In the old days (3 years ago), the previous collective that operated out of this space used to throw parties in the basement, but whenever there were parties, the neighbors would often make noise complaints, and so now we don’t have parties and instead use the basement as a storage space, and recently as a work space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I did when I started helping to re-organize the basement was to cut up a hand-made bench in the corner of the basement that had a DJ set list painted onto it from a a party that must have been years ago. Basements are a funny sort of archive. We removed the bench and put it outside in some grass in front of a nearby church — almost every day since then I’ve seen people sitting on those benches hanging out. The world works in mysterious ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a part of me that misses how Sari-Sari felt to me when I didn’t know about the basement. For me it was purely a realm for exploration, improvisation, cooking, dancing and meeting new people. Since I learned about the basement, I’ve spent more of my time thinking about what infrastructure (physical, social and financial) underlies this creative room. When I am in a darker mood I feel like I must have fulfilled my own subconscious longings and found my way into the basement because of my puritanical upbringing that needed “to understand”. In a lighter mood, like right now, it feels like nothing is ever too late and the most true way to see our own movements is with gentleness. I gravitated to the basement because I loved the space and I was asked to take responsibility for it. I got pulled into this energy, but instead of being sucked into a masochistic narrative, how can I creatively respond to the situation, to work with what’s there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepe and I are putting a carpet in the basement. I would also like to perform some type of group ritual down there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My freshman and sophomore years of high school I didn’t have many friends — I spent a lot of time next to
the router making angsty electronic music. I kept a small MIDI keyboard and microphone on a fold-able table in
the closet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made hundreds of songs, and used iWeb (apple’s WYISWYG website maker) to make a website to ‘publish’ the
music to. I spent hours photographing my dog, and random plants and photo-shopping the images together into
album art. I put all the songs and album art onto &lt;a href=&quot;http://maximusfowler.com&quot;&gt;http://maximusfowler.com&lt;/a&gt; and
didn’t share the website or music with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last spring I looked up maximusfowler.com on the wayback machine and found three entries:

&lt;p&gt;I clicked through to Music.html and found the following remnant of a page from 2009:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090323231502/http://www.maximusfowler.com/maximusproductions/Music.html%22%3Ehttps://web.archive.org/web/20090323231502/http://www.maximusfowler.com/maximusproductions/Music.html&quot;&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090323231502/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrolling through the blue letters on the dark background, thinking about echoes of a memory, of looking out
the window of my bedroom at night, and an even more distant memory of barefoot stepping on a firecracker and
crying, of diving into a lake and passing through an unexpected cold patch of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps these dark blue letters and empty boxes reverberate my childhood to me more deeply than if all the
pages of the site remained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
