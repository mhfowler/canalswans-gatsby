A Year In Review  
my resume  
your resume  
walk into a bar  
creating endless output   
for generations  
hot showers  
seemed necessary   
until cold showers seemed beautiful   
energy efficiency -> energy sufficiency  
two nights ago I dreamed that I   
was trying to get a job at a pizza restaurant   
all of a sudden it all made sense  
why artists work at pizza restaurants  
it felt like a cosmic gift   
joyfully revealing itself  
feelings of relief  
on the first day we were a having a meeting with the staff  
and the boss was telling us   
that we needed to clean and organize the restaurant   
she said she wanted to add an aquarium to the main room and asked me to go find an aquarium tank  
i took the train to go find the tank   
somehow i took a wrong turn   
i was worried i would be late   
i had a stress dream about trying to find the aquarium tank store   
i woke up while still trying to triangulate where the store might be  
--> on the way to 2020,   
with hopes of growing ecological alignment  
delicious pizzas  
happy solstice
